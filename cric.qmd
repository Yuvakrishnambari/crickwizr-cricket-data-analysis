### ##Predicted vs. Actual Runs Predictive code

**Predicting Batsman Performance**

-   Developed a predictive model to forecast a batsman's runs in an over based on their previous performance.

-   Utilized historical data to train the model, considering factors like recent form, opponent bowling attack, and pitch conditions.

-   Evaluated the model's accuracy using appropriate metrics and refined it iteratively.

Compared predicted and actual runs, validating the predictive model’s effectiveness and here is the code:

**Lets get into code:**

**1. Calculate Runs Scored by Each Batsman in Each Over:**

-   **`batsman_performance <- deliveries %>%`**: This line starts a data manipulation pipeline using the `dplyr` package. It takes the `deliveries` dataset as input.

-   **`group_by(match_id, over, batsman)`**: This groups the data by `match_id`, `over`, and `batsman`, creating a separate group for each combination of these variables.

-   **`summarize(total_runs = sum(batsman_runs, na.rm = TRUE))`**: This calculates the total runs scored by each batsman in each over, handling missing values (`na.rm = TRUE`).

-   **`ungroup()`**: This ungroups the data, returning it to a single data frame.

**2. Predict Runs for a Batsman in an Over Based on Previous Performance:**

-   **`arrange(match_id, batsman, over)`**: This sorts the data by `match_id`, `batsman`, and `over`, ensuring that the data is ordered chronologically within each match for each batsman.

-   **`group_by(match_id, batsman)`**: This groups the data again by `match_id` and `batsman` to perform calculations within each match-batsman combination.

-   **`mutate(predicted_runs = lag(total_runs))`**: This creates a new column called `predicted_runs`. For each row, it assigns the value of `total_runs` from the previous row, effectively predicting the current over's runs based on the previous over's performance.

-   **`ungroup()`**: This ungroups the data again, returning it to a single data frame.

**Overall:**

This code calculates the total runs scored by each batsman in each over and then predicts the number of runs a batsman might score in the current over based on their performance in the previous over. This type of analysis could be useful for various purposes, such as:

-   **Predicting Player Performance:** Using historical data to forecast future performance.

-   **In-Match Decision Making:** Providing insights to coaches or players during a match.

-   **Fantasy Cricket:** Assisting in player selection and strategy.

By analyzing these predictions and comparing them to actual performance, we can gain valuable insights into player behavior and potential strategies.
